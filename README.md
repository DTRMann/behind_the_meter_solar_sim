# behind_the_meter_solar_sim
This project pulls data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) PVWatts API into a pandas Dataframe, and then it stores the dataframe in a .db file. The objective of the project is to simulate the impact of behind-the-meter solar on hourly electricity load, and determine whether a select sampling of behind-the-meter solar systems could be used to improve situational awareness of residential solar output.

A write-up of the analysis can be found here: https://theeternalspicecycle.wordpress.com/2018/03/29/framework-for-estimating-behind-the-meter-solar-generation/
